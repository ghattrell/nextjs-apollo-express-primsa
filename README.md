# nextjs-apollo-express-prisma

This is just a boiler plate for a fullstack web app using Prisma 2, Apollo 2, Express and Next JS. Download the repo and build your app out.

##Quickstart

Add in the blanks which have been provided in the env.sample in the root directory. 

Note that whatever you do call your mysql container will need to be added to the /backend/prisma/.env config file in the connection string. I have provided the standard prisma mysql connection string, but more info is provided in the link within that file.

```
docker-compose up --build
```
